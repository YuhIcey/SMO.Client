# SMO.Client

SMO.Client is the multiplayer launcher for Sierra Madre Online, a Fallout: New Vegas multiplayer mod.

It connects to online servers, injects the multiplayer hook into Fallout: New Vegas, and enables the client-side systems needed for multiplayer play.

This project is still in early alpha. Things will break. Features will change. Use at your own risk.
